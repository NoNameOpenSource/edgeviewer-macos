## Overview
EdgeViewer is an open source application that aims to be a universal viewer for Manga and other comic book-like content. <a href="https://github.com/NoNameOpenSource/edgeviewer-macos/releases/download/0.1.0/EdgeViewer.app.zip">Download EdgeViewer.</a> EdgeViewer comes out of the box with support for locally-stored content, but you can add plugins written in JavaScript to bring in content from other sources. See the [Plugins](#plugins) section for more information.

## Plugins and Contributions
EdgeViewer provides a simple mechanism for installing plugins written in JavaScript that seamlessly integrate with the rest of the application. Though we do not officially support or endorse any third-party plugins, EdgeViewer cannot thrive without an active community of plugin creators. Additionally, we welcome Pull Requests to our central codebase on this repository.
