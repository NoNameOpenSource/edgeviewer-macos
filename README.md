##Overview
EdgeViewer is an open source application that aims to be a universal viewer for Manga and other comic book-like content. EdgeViewer comes out of the box with support for locally-stored content, but you can add plugins written in JavaScript to bring in content from other sources. See the [Plugins](#plugins) section for more information.

##Contributing

EdgeViewer cannot exist without a community that contributes to both the central codebase and to the creation of plugins. See the [Plugins](#plugins) section for more information.

##Plugins

Only the central codebase is hosted on our GitHub account. EdgeViewer provides a simple mechanism for installing plugins written in JavaScript that seamlessly integrate with the rest of the application. Though we do not officially support or endorse any third-party plugins, EdgeViewer cannot thrive without an active community of plugin creators. For a list of unsupported plugins, please see the [EdgeViewer Third-Party Plugins](https://ggomong.com/edgeviewer/plugins) list. To have your plugin featured on this list, contact us at [contributions@ggomong.com](mailto:contributions@ggomong.com).
